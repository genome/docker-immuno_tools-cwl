Due to worries about backward compatibility, the original file `optitype_script.sh` was left untouched and
a new file `optitype_script_wdl.sh` has been created, tailored for the `wdl` pipeline.

`optitype_script_wdl.sh` allows for control over RAM and CPU usage. 
It also massively improves performance (from ~5h to ~20m) at the expense of a bit of sensitivity.
